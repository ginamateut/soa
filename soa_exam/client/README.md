This is a Microservices project for the Service Oriented Architecture class.

The idea of the application is to have a place where you can store your notes and reminders.
For deploying the application it is needed to have
    -> docker for desktop
    -> skaffold
    -> go to /etc/hosts and add line "127.0.0.1 posts.com"
    -> go to root folder of the project 
    -> run skaffold dev
    -> access posts.com 
    
Enjoy!
